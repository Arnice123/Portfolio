# Arya Akhavein DMA Portfolio

This year I worked on creating a game with Marting Anderson. I worked on all of the enemy AI and the player animations and some of the enviroment on the spawn island. You can view and play the game [here](https://link-url-here.org) but in this github repo you can view the work I have made during this semester.

In the [EnemyBaseScript](https://github.com/Arnice123/Portfolio/blob/main/EnemyBaseScript.cs) I programmed the enemies so that they can do the basic function but the states like their movements and their attacking code is here in the [TimeToFight Script](https://github.com/Arnice123/Portfolio/blob/main/TimeToFight).

You can also view my more miscelanius code [here](https://link-url-here.org)
