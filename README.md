# Arya Akhavein DMA Portfolio

This year I worked on creating a game with Marting Anderson. I worked on all of the enemy AI and the player animations and some of the enviroment on the spawn island. You can view and play the game [here](https://link-url-here.org) but in this github repo you can view the work I have made during this semester.
